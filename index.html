    Overview:
    </h2>
    <p class="main-paragraph" style="padding:2px;margin-top:5px" >
    In the case of Texas v. Johnson, Gregory Lee Johnson was charged by the state of Texas for burning the American flag. This  flag desecrating act was illegal in Texas at the time. Johnson fought in court for his right to the first Ammendment, which gave him the freedom of expression. Texas argued that burning the flag would lead to riots, and that the flag had a special meaning that shouldn't be destroyed. On the other hand, Johnson argued that burning the flag was protected by his 1st Ammendment right, and that if he got punished for this, the government was overreaching.

    The real question:
    </h2>
    <p class="main-paragraph">
    The case surprisingly ended up in supreme court, due to the constitutional question of whether burning the flag is protected by the 1st ammendment or not. The court agreed to hear the case due to the significance that the question held.
