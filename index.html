    <p class="main-paragraph">
    In the case of Texas v. Johnson, Gregory Lee Johnson was charged by the state of Texas for burning the American flag, which he did to protest the policies that Ronald Regan had on the cold war. This  flag desecrating act was illegal in Texas at the time. Johnson fought in court for his right to the first Ammendment, which gave him the freedom of expression. Texas argued that burning the flag would lead to riots, and that the flag had a special meaning that shouldn't be destroyed. On the other hand, Johnson argued that burning the flag was protected by his 1st Ammendment right, and that if he got punished for this, the government was overreaching.

    The real question:
    </h2>
    <p class="main-paragraph">
    The case surprisingly ended up in supreme court, due to the constitutional question of whether burning the flag is protected by the 1st Ammendment or not. The court agreed to hear the case due to the significance that the question held.

    The final decision:
    </h2>
    <p class="main-paragraph">
    The supreme court had agreed with Johnson, in a 5-4 (For-Against) decision. They decided that the 1st Ammendment did protect the right to burn the flag, even if it did offend people. This was because they thought it was a form of symbolic speech, and that the government shouldn't top it. The dissenting opinion was that the act of flag burning wasn't essential for Johnson to get his opinion out, and he could have done it in a more peaceful way. the concurring opinion was more emotional, rather than legal, where the justice pointed out that even though it's protected, it was definitely a wrong thing to do.

    The real significance:
    </h2>
    <p class="main-paragraph">
    This case was mainly significant because of the impact it had on the opinion people had on free speech, it showed that even if the speech was offensive, or disliked, it couldn't be restricted by the government. However, even though the right to burn the flag is acceptable under the guise of freedom of speech, it should still be unacceptable to the people of the United States of America, for it still holds significant values.
